Tweet/Picture general remark-

A message, now?
Not exactly the best time, but I should see what it says.
I really hope no one wants to know what I'm up to...

Still need to do-
Tweets (2-3?)
Picture reasons/objectives (2)
Endings

Idea suggestions:
Change general social media thing to just texting your date and whatnot and ensuring everything's okay
Changing last objective to finding a lockpicking book rather than just finding a key
