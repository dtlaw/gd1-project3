Endings-
Good End (get out before time runs out):
Well, I got out in time, and not too soon either.
Still had enough time to make sure our dinner was going to be ready.
The date itself? Well, it was a bit awkward, trying not to mention I was stuck for awhile...
But I think it went well. Neither of us ran away from each other screaming or anything, so that's a step!
We've got another date planned next week, too!
At least this time I won't be in danger of getting myself stuck in the bathroom!

[One Week Later]

...Well, I'm not stuck in the bathroom, but I am stuck in traffic.
No getting out of this one, just going to have to hope this doesn't ruin it...

Bad End (run out of time):
Unfortunately, it was too late. I was just sitting on the toilet when she came in.
I was so embarrassed, I just ran off. Had a bit of a fight over the phone too, so things aren't doing well.
We could probably talk things out, but it might be awhile. Either way, the date didn't even happen.
Not to mention I got nothing out of anything I spent... maybe I shouldn't waste my time or money on dating.

Final Score Screen (rankings?):
Romantic- You had a sauve setup, even under pressure. Marvelous work!
Average- It was a bit of a rush job, but it could have been worse.
Mediocre- Rather poor showing, try to be a bit more convincing next time.
