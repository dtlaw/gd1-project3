Endings-
Good End (get out before time runs out):
Well, I got out in time, and not too soon either.
Still had enough time to make sure our dinner was going to be ready.
The date itself? Well, it was a bit awkward, trying not to mention I was stuck for awhile...
But I think it went well. Neither of us ran away from each other screaming or anything, so that's a step!
We've got another date planned next week, too! Things are looking up!

Bad End (run out of time):
Unfortunately, it was too late. My date got here while I was still in the bathroom.
The date ended up being pretty embarrassing. We didn't try to talk about it, so a lot of it ended up being awkward silence.
We did agree on trying again, but the next one won't really be the same without some of that Valentine's magic, yanno?
Ah well, could be worse.

Final Score Screen (rankings?):
Romantic- You had a sauve setup, even under pressure. Marvelous work!
Average- It was a bit of a rush job, but it could have been worse.
Mediocre- Rather poor showing, try to be a bit more convincing next time.
