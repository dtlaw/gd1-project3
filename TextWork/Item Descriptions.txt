Item descriptions-

Bobby pin- One of those pins for holding up hair. Also the classic fallback for when you need to pick a lock.
Poster with a riddle on it- There's a poster here for some reason. Seems rather weird to have one in a hotel, but maybe it's to spruce it up?
Chair- A simple chair. Looks like one of the ones from the main room, guess they forgot to put it back in there.
Shower curtains- Some cheap shower curtains on one of those extending rods. Nice and monochrome.
Towels- A set of nice, white towels. They feel pretty soft, so that ought to feel good when drying off.
Cabinet/shelves- One of those shelf cabinets, with all sorts of bathroom supplies in it. Kinda boring, really.
Mirror- There's me and everything else around me. Might have to freshen up again once I'm out.
Book (?)- Dummies' Guide to Lockpicking. Most of it seems to be about using all kinds of different tools, but it doesn't fail to mention various improvised lockpicks.
Key- An old-fashioned key. It probably fits the lock out of here... I hope, at least.
