Task descriptions

Attempt to open the door- Come on... damn, no good! What kind of dumb bathroom door needs a key like this anyhow?
[[[This'll probably be written out but just having it boxed for whenever people look at this: Find something to pick the lock with- The classic, a bobby pin. It's not much, but maybe it'll be enough to get it open.
Attempt to pick the lock- Alright, here we go, just have to jiggle it a bit, and... uh... how do I pick a lock with a bobby pin... okay guess I can't do that if I don't know how.]]]
Try the window- Window doesn't seem to locked, so up you go... wait a minute, I'm on the eighth floor. Nevermind, kinda wanted to live on Valentine's Day.
(Upon seeing the airvent...?)- Ah, an airvent, classic method of escape in half of every action film. Just need to reach it...
Find something to reach the airvent- Ah, this table should work. Just need to clean it off and wheel it over.
Try to open the airvent- That's open, now... oh. It's a bit too small... Nevermind, that's not happening either. What else am I supposed to do...
Examine the riddle- Let's see, maybe one of the things in the trash... huh. There's a riddle on the back of this paper? "See what you saw, and saw two halves into a whole." What does that even mean?
Solve the riddle- A saw in the mirror? That doesn't... oh I get it. Saw something in half and make a whole, which is a hole, and... no no no am I crazy? That's Looney Tunes logic! And there can't be a saw there, there was nothing there before! I'm losing it, aren't I...
Vent your frustrations- Stupid freaking... I just want to get out of here! Why the hell does a bathroom door like that even lock with a key?! Damnit, maybe if I break the door down that'll work...
Take another shower- ...Know what, no, I can't get worked up like this. I'll look like a mess again and they'll wring more money out of me if I mess up the place. I'll just take another shower, get my head back together, and see what I think of...
(After the shower)- Well, I feel a little better. Still no clue where to look though... hang on a second, is that a key...? Did they seriously hide it in the towels? Well that's silly, but now's my chance!
Use the key on the door- Aaaand... it worked! I'm out of here, yes!
