Text 1 (for alternate idea)- Hey, work's going to be done soon, so I'll be there in about an hour. Everything ready?

#ready- Yep, should be good to go pretty soon.
Response- Alright, cool, I'll be there as soon as I can. [Subtracts time or keeps time the same?]
#busy- Bit busy right now, I'll let you know when things are good.
Response- That's fine, just keep me up to date. [Keeps time the same or adds time?]
#trouble- Some stuff came up suddenly, could you give me a bit?
Response- Alright then, I'll need to get ready too. Keep me up to date though, alright?
You- I will. [Adds time?]

#ignore- (Better just stall a bit...)
Response- Hello? Everything alright? [Subtracts time]

Text 2 (for alternate idea)- I'll be pulling up in a few minutes, just wanted to check if the reservation's set up?

#delayed- They had to push it back a bit, but not too much.
Response- Alright, we'll just hang out in the room for a bit. I'll come up. [Keeps time the same or adds time?]
#ontime- Yeah, it'll be on time, I double checked.
Response- Cool, could you meet me down here then? I'll just be a few minutes. [Subtracts time]

#ignore- (I don't need to answer, do I...?)
Response- Everything alright? Hello? [Subtracts time]
