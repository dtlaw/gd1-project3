Introduction:

Finally, the first year I've got a date on Valentine's Day!
I can't screw this up, so I've decided to book us a hotel date and a nice dinner!
It won't start for a few hours, but I came in advance to set things up.
Gotta let all my friends know how lucky I was this year... let's see...
"Setting up for the big date. #Valentine #lucky"
And just need a picture of the main room... got it. Aaaaand uploaded!
They'll probably want to know how it's going, so I'll have to keep them up to date.
Before I do anything else, should take a shower so I'm all fresh and ready to go!

...
...
...

Alright then, that's that, now to just go and... wait a minute.
The door's locked? Really? What kind of weird bathroom locks from the inside?
If it uses the same key for the door, then that's no good, that's outside on the table.
Agggh... I gotta get out of here! No one's going to want to be with someone who gets trapped in the bathroom!

It won't start for a few hours, but I came in advance to set things up.
My date wants to know how the place looks, so...
And there's a picture of the main room, just gonna send it... and there.
I should send a few more, give a good idea of how it looks.
I hope it sends a good impression, spent a lot of money on this.
