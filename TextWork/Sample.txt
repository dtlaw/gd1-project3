Introduction:

Finally, the first year I've got a date on Valentine's Day!
I can't screw this up, so I've decided to book us a hotel date!
She won't be here for a few hours, she had to work today, so I came in advance to set things up.
Gotta let all my friends know how lucky I was this year... let's see...
"Setting up for the big date. #Valentine #lucky"
And just need a picture of the main room... got it. Aaaaand uploaded!
They'll probably want to know how it's going, so I'll have to keep them up to date.
Before I do anything else, should take a shower, be ready to go when she gets here!

Alright then, that's that, now to just go and... wait a minute.
The door's locked? Really? What kind of weird bathroom locks from the inside?
If it uses the same key for the door, then that's no good, that's outside on the table.
Agggh... I gotta get out of here before she gets here! No girl's going to want to be with a guy who traps himself in the bathroom!

got a picture of it all laid out?

#fakeit #stall

(#fakeit would involve trying to do a picture, #stall would give a bit more time but would delay it for later)

Ooh, what are you having?
